  Output: The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the 
    return value of that function. We want this function to take one argument, 
    x, and return x without modifying it. Delete the pound
    sign so that x is returned without any modification. Make sure to save your
    script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: smarttest()
  Hint: Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.
  Script: boring_function.R
